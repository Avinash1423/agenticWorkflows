# Agentic Patterns with Java & Spring AI
This repo contains Java implementations of Agentic Patterns described by Anthropic, using Spring AI.

Implemented Patterns:
Prompt Chaining – Output of one prompt is passed to the next

Routing – Routes input to the most suitable agent or prompt

Sectioning – Splits a task into sections and processes them (1 of 2 parallelization strategies)

Orchestrator–Workers – Orchestrator breaks tasks and assigns to worker agents

Evaluator–Optimizer – Evaluator scores outputs, Optimizer refines them
